# DynamicProgramming
This project solves the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem using Dynamic Programming. The LCS problem is widely used in fields such as genetic sequence analysis, spell checking, and bioinformatics. Given two input strings, this program calculates the length and characters of the longest subsequence that appears in both strings.
